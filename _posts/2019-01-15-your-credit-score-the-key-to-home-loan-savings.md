Your credit score is a fundamental piece in the home buying process. At the outset, your score is the determining factor in whether you do or don’t qualify for a home loan, **but it’s also the determining factor in the loan size you’re approved for.**

Home loans are commonly structured to break down pricing based upon 20-point credit score increments, ranging from a score of 620 through 800. **It’s important to be within a bracket that will allow you to qualify for the best loan possible.** Some of my clients have fallen short by a single point, and that point could have been the difference in them saving a lot of money.

**We use credit diagnostic tools to try to bump our clients’ scores up.** Sometimes, we advise them to do something as simple as paying down a charge card from a department store.

I’ve had clients who’ve saved themselves thousands of dollars over the life of a mortgage by paying a little extra toward their credit card early. Doing this could propel you into a higher credit score group and save you money as you apply for a loan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
