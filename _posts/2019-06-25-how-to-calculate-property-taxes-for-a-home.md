In general, property taxes are 1.25% of a home’s purchase price per year. If you bought a home for $500,000, you would take that number and multiply it by 0.125%, which gives you $6,250.&nbsp;

That would be your annual amount of property taxes that you would have to pay (estimated). **To figure out your monthly property tax bill, you would just divide that number by 12 and get $512 per month.**

When you're looking at buying a home, it’s important to understand not only the principal and interest portion of the payment, but also the property tax payment. Don’t forget about home insurance and mortgage insurance, either. **This is why it’s really important to get a total estimate for your monthly payment before you decide to buy.**

The way I always like to say to customers is that there are three important things to remember when buying a home:

**1\. How much is it going to cost you per month?<br>2\. What’s your out-of-pocket cost?<br>3\. What risks are you taking with your loan?**

If you ever want to discuss your particular situation or if you have any questions about mortgages for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
