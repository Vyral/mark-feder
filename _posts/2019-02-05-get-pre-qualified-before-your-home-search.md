If you’re a homebuyer, why is it so beneficial to get pre-qualified (or pre-approved) before you start your home search?

For one thing, **you’ll get a written pre-approval that you’ll be able to include with your offer once you’ve found the home you want.** If that home has other offers on it, the seller won’t seriously consider any that don’t have a pre-approval. In other words, you’ll give yourself a better chance of having your offer accepted.

Having said that, there’s no guarantee that just because you get pre-approved, you’re still going to end up buying a home, so keep in mind that this is a considerable time commitment on your end, and you must be ready for homeownership if you’re going to go through with it.

If you’d like to talk more about what’s involved in the pre-qualification or pre-approval process, don’t hesitate to call or email me at your earliest convenience. If you have any other mortgage questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.
