When people are wanting to acquire a home loan, it’s important for them to look at what income can be used to help qualify.

In general, you can use your base salary, commissions, bonuses, tips, etc. **Anything works as long as you’ve had at least a two-year history of receiving it.**

You can also use retirement or disability pay **as long as it continues for at least three more years after the date the loan closes.** The same goes for alimony, child support, and other maintenance payments.&nbsp;

You cannot count one-time bonuses, capital gains from one-time stock transactions, or the money you would be making from a business you sold.&nbsp;

It’s always important to know what you can factor into your application, and I’d be more than happy to help you figure it out. If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
