Many borrowers, especially first-time homebuyers, ask me if it makes sense for them to pay a little bit extra toward their closing costs or discount points so they can save some money on their monthly payments.

Like everything in mortgages, my answer is that **it depends.**

If you paid, say, an extra $3,000 in discount points and you were to save $60 per month, you’d then need to assess that over the life of your loan, which is usually 30 years. **In this example, you’d save upward of $20,000.**

However, this is an oversimplification of the calculation. To look at it the correct way, divide that extra $3,000 payment by month to come up with your payback period. That means if you paid the extra $3,000 upfront when you close on a loan, saving you $60 a month, **it would take you 50 months (or four years and two months) to recover that $3,000.**

People also ask me what a correct payback period looks like. Again, this depends on your situation.

If you’re a first-time homebuyer purchasing a 1-bedroom condo who thought you were only going to live there for three to five years, and your payback period was four years, I would say that **it doesn’t really make sense for you to pay extra. I’d rather you just take the deal as it is and save that $3,000—you’re not going to be in the loan long enough to recoup your extra investment.**

If you had a two-year-old child at home and you were moving to a neighborhood because the school there was good, you’ve got a reasonably good chance of staying in that home for at least the next 16 years. In this case, if you paid the extra $3,000 upfront to save $60 a month (or $720 a year) for 16 years, **you’d be saving upward of $10,000—you’d basically triple your money.**

If you’d like to evaluate your unique situation, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to help you assess whether this is the right move for you.
