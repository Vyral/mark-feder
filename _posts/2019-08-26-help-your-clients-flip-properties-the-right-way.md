If you have clients interested in flipping properties, how can you help them finance these properties and guide them through the rest of the process?&nbsp;

I’ve been in the mortgage industry for a long time, but I’ve also been flipping houses since 2008, so there are several key factors to keep in mind.&nbsp;

**The first and most important is your client’s exit value.** Assuming you and your client fix up the house to the condition you agreed upon, what will it sell for? Once you have that number, subtract the cost of sale (agent commission, transfer tax, etc.) to get your net sale proceeds. After that, you’ll have to figure out how much work it will cost you to realize your net sale proceeds. Once all these terms are configured, you can determine how much to pay for the home.

When you’ve estimated all these factors, you can start outlining the project and determine whether it will work for your client.&nbsp;

**On the financing side, flipping a property is fairly straightforward.** You can either pay for it in cash, use a hard-money loan, or do some type of bank financing. The simplest way is to pay in cash. Using a hard money loan is the next easiest method. Bank financing is a little more difficult because you’re purchasing a property that’s probably not in the best condition. Oftentimes, most of the money made from a home flip comes from buying the property at a price that actually works.&nbsp;
