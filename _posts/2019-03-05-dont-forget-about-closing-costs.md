When buying a home, your down payment isn’t the only expense you’ll need to prepare for ahead of time. There’s also the matter of closing costs.&nbsp;

**To give you a better idea of how much you’ll need to set aside, I’d like to share the typical price of closing costs here in San Diego, specifically.** The dollar amount of your closing costs will vary depending on your market, though, so keep this in mind if you live elsewhere.&nbsp;

First, there’s the matter of the administration (or underwriting) fee. This fee, which is paid to the lender, is generally about $1,000.&nbsp;

You will also be expected to pay for an appraisal, which tends to run between $500 and $700. Next, you will need to budget for your credit report. This can cost as little as $20.&nbsp;

**There are also third-party fees to consider, which will include title, escrow, notary, and recording fees.** For a $500,000 home in San Diego, these fees would likely total to about $3,500 altogether.&nbsp;

All told, you should probably plan to spend around $5,100 in closing costs on an average home in our area. However, this figure doesn’t include prepaid items like interest, insurance, and property taxes. On a $400,000 home, interest might run you approximately $1,000, insurance will cost approximately $1,200, and your property taxes (depending on the area) will generally cost about $2,000.&nbsp;

**The bottom line is that these closing costs can carry a quite significant price tag.** You should always take these additional expenses into account as you budget for your home purchase.
