When a person sets out to purchase an investment property, they generally have one of two strategies in mind: **to reap the benefits of appreciation or to enjoy monthly cash flow.&nbsp;**

In a perfect world, we’d all be able to purchase a property that appreciates dramatically and yields great cash flow each month, but in reality, it’s often an either/or scenario. **Some properties have tons of appreciation potential, while others lend themselves to a cash flow model.&nbsp;**

To better illustrate my point, consider this: If you bought a $15 or $16 million property on the beach in Del Mar, you could probably expect its value to go up exponentially year over year, but the rent you’d charge couldn’t possibly offset your mortgage.&nbsp;

Conversely, say you were to buy an apartment building at $200,000 per unit. While it’s unlikely to go up much in value, but if you filled the space and charged $1,700 in rent, chances are that you’ll gain a cash flow return on the property.&nbsp;

When you’re looking at a potential investment, it’s very important to identify which strategy you’d like to pursue and how you’re capitalized. Some key questions to consider are:&nbsp;

* **Do you have the wherewithal to hold onto a property long term?&nbsp;**
* **Are you looking to break even or generate positive cash flow?&nbsp;**
* **Is your aim to buy a fixer-upper and turn a profit on it in a year?** &nbsp;&nbsp;
