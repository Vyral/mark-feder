**If you’re a homebuyer making monthly payments for mortgage insurance on an FHA loan, there are a couple of ways to eliminate those payments:**

If you have an FHA loan where you put less than 10% down on the home purchase, you’ll be expected to pay mortgage insurance for the life of that loan. The only way to eliminate that expense would be to refinance the loan into another loan type that doesn’t require mortgage insurance.&nbsp;

Now, if you had an FHA loan and started with a down payment of 10% or more, you’ll only have to pay mortgage insurance for 132 months, or 11 years—after that point, it goes away.

I’m in the middle of helping a client of mine refinance their own loan from a couple of years ago, which was an FHA with a down payment of less than 10%. This made sense, as they now have enough equity, good credit, and a good rate environment to refinance into a conventional loan. They’re now saving more than a couple hundred dollars a month.

**If you have a conventional loan, there are three ways to get rid of your mortgage insurance:**

**1. Paying down the loan so you have 22% equity from the original purchase price.** Depending on your down payment, this could take as little as two or three years or as long as 10 or 11 years.

**2. Paying the loan down a little faster or reappraising the home after two years of having the conventional loan.** You can apply to the mortgage company to see if your home has enough equity to cancel the mortgage insurance.

**3. Look at your home’s current value, your credit history, and the current rate climate.** If these conditions are right, you can refinance your loan and get a similar rate (perhaps a bit lower or higher), eliminating your mortgage insurance and locking in your savings.
