Agents often ask me if we can close a deal in 17 or 21 days instead of 30. Truthfully, we can, but while many agents think this is a big advantage for their buyers, it can sometimes actually hurt them.

**When we’re doing a quick escrow, the loan originator has to condense their time frame into a very short window.** Clients have little time to prepare documentation, review it, and respond to all the moving parts of a loan. We’re often having to call two to three times a day for 14 days straight. The average buyer will get worn out by this, and we see many of these deals fall apart due to the pressure.

It’s easy for clients to feel like they’ve been pushed into a corner, so I always tell my Realtor partners to really weigh the options. **We’re not against short escrows, but it’s important to know that the pressure is high.&nbsp;**

I’m always happy to talk with you or your clients more about the process, and if you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
