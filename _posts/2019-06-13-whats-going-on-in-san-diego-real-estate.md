We’re just starting out in the summer buying season, and there is already a lot of interest out there from first-time buyers and move-up buyers. Homes are selling quickly in all price points, but specifically below the $1 million-mark. We’ve seen pretty strong demand this entire year, and with dropping interest rates, homes are cheaper now than they were even six months ago. If you or someone you know is interested in taking advantage of these conditions as well, don’t hesitate to reach out to us today.
