When residential agents are looking to get into the rental business and advise clients on potential rental properties, they’re going to hear a lot of terms like ‘rent multipliers,’ ‘cap rates,’ ‘operating expenses,’ ‘net operating income,’ and so on. These terms can sound confusing, but they’re actually fairly straightforward to understand. Today I’ll tackle cap rates so that you can better understand the concept.

**Cap rate means ‘capitalization rate.’** In non-finance terms, ‘net operating income’ refers to what your actual cash return would be if you paid cash for a property, rented it out, and allotted a certain amount of money for ownership costs. If you take that net operating income and divide it by the purchase price of the property (plus the amount you spent on fixing it up), you’d get the cap rate.

Here’s an example: Let’s say you bought a four-unit building in San Diego for $1 million and that you spent $200,000 to fix it up; you’d have $1.2 million tied up in the property. Now let’s assume that the rents would be $8,000 for the whole building ($2,000 per door); that would give you an annual rent of $96,000. Then assume that it costs $40,000 to operate that building, including property tax insurance, maintenance, management, water, sewage, trash, etc. All in all, you’d be left with a net operating income of $56,000. **When you’re looking at cap rates, you assume that there’s no mortgage, so you take the $56,000 and divide it by the $1.2 million to calculate your cap rate: about 4.7%**
