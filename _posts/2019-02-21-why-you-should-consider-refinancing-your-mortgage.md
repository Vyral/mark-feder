Today I’m excited to talk about a few reasons why homeowners decide refinance their mortgage. **The most common reason people refinance is because they want to lower their interest rate on their mortgage.**

Another common reason is debt consolidation, which is when someone uses the equity in their home to pay off things like credit cards and car loans. These things have much higher interest rates than their refinanced mortgage would, so this helps them to save a lot of cash flow from a monthly perspective.

People often sometimes refinance because, after seeing their homes go up in value, they want to upgrade. By refinancing, they can pull out cash from their home’s equity and use that money to remodel and further increase their home’s value.

**A few other scenarios where we see refinancing include:**

* A homeowner with an adjustable rate loan who wants to change to a fixed-rate loan.
* A homeowner who has 25 years left on a 30-year fixed rate loan and decides they want to refinance to a 15-year loan in order to pay it off sooner.

If you have any questions about refinancing or want to talk about your specific situation, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
