When it comes to getting a mortgage loan, the three most important considerations you need to make are:

* **How much it will cost you out of pocket** (i.e., your down payment and closing costs).
* **How much it will cost you on a monthly basis** (i.e., your principal and interest payment, property tax, home insurance, and HOA dues).
* **Where/when the monthly payments change.**

To explain how these factors impact you, let’s say you were to buy a house here in San Diego for $500,000 with a conventional loan.

As far as out-of-pocket expenses go, you’d be able to put down as little as $25,000 for your down payment and then use $8,000 to $10,000 to cover your closing costs. What this would cost you on a monthly basis depends on your interest rate at the time of purchase, your property tax, the home insurance costs, and the lifespan of your mortgage.

The parts of the mortgage that can change over time are the property tax and home insurance costs. In California, property taxes can only increase at a maximum of 2% per year, so if your property tax started at $500 a month, you should plan on paying $510 per month a year from now, and $520 per month a year after that.

Home insurance costs usually increase at a rate of 3% per year. For example, if your home insurance cost started at $100 per month, you should plan on paying $103 per month a year from now. If you have to pay HOA dues, those can vary substantially based on the responsibilities of the homeowners association and the age of the building in which you bought your property. In most cases, the older a building gets, the more the HOA dues increase because there’s more maintenance required.
