Before you take your buyers out looking at homes, there are three important things they need to know:

**1\.** What are their monthly payments?&nbsp;<br>**2\.** How much will they be paying for closing costs and a down payment?<br>**3\.** What can go wrong with their home loan?

{% include pullquote.html %}

**The best way to answer these questions is to have your buyers speak with a qualified mortgage professional.** By getting your client quality, accurate advice, you’ll be able to avoid potential issues in the transaction down the road. On top of this, your clients will have a much higher chance of closing the deal.

**I’d be more than happy to help you and your clients answer these three important questions.** If you’d like me to run through one of your client’s specific scenarios, give me a call at 858-337-1520. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
