A number of the agents I work with have been calling me lately because their clients are interested in purchasing investment property. They want to gain a stronger understanding of how such a move will work out for their client in the long run.&nbsp;

A major factor in determining whether a piece of real estate is a sound investment is calculating its **operating expenses.** Examples include property taxes, home insurance, maintenance, repairs, legal items, accounting items, utilities, trash, and so on.&nbsp;

**Once you account for the property’s operating expenses, you’ll know what it will cost to run the property.** Using an example, say your client bought a property for $1 million and rent amounts to $100,000 each year. The property comes with a vacancy factor of $5,000, $15,000 in property taxes, $5,000 in insurance, another $5,000 for management, and the remaining $10,000 goes to maintenance, sewer, water, trash, and accounting. Add it all up and your operating expenses total $35,000.&nbsp;

It’s important to note that **because newer buildings tend to require fewer repairs, their operating expenses will be lower.** Conversely, you can expect a property built in, say, the 1920s or 1930s to carry markedly higher operating expenses. The components of a century-old building will have gone through years of use and general wear and tear, meaning those items will require repair or replacement much sooner.&nbsp;

By figuring operating costs into the equation, you’ll help your client understand what their bottom line will be and whether a particular property is a worthwhile investment.&nbsp;
