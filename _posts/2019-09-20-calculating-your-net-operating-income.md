Net operating income (NOI) is a term you’ll come across rather often when you purchase investment property. But **what is net operating income and how is it calculated?&nbsp;**

Allow me to explain using an example. Let’s say the gross rent on a building amounts to $100,000 per year and your annual expenses before the mortgage payment are $40,000. In this case, your NOI is the difference: $60,000.&nbsp;

Let’s take a step back and break down your annual expenses. Suppose on that same building you pay a vacancy factor of $5,000, another $5,000 in management costs, $15,000 in property taxes, and additional fees like maintenance, garbage, water, etc. These are known as your **operating costs.** When you’ve accounted for all your operating costs, you’ll reach a total of $40,000, which, again, gives you an NOI of $60,000.&nbsp;

Knowing your NOI is very important when you’re evaluating an investment property because your borrower will want to know how much of a return the property will yield on an all-cash purchase.&nbsp;

Using another example, say an investor buys a building for $1 million and they receive $100,000 in rental income. If, after figuring in operating costs, their NOI is $60,000, it would mean they’re seeing a 6% return on investment. This is determined by dividing NOI by the original purchase price. &nbsp;If they needed to shell out $200,000 to remodel the property, you’d take the $60,000 NOI and divide it by $1.2 million—a 5% rate of return.&nbsp;
